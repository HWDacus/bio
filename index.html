            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 div1"><p>Gonzalo Barrios, better known by his gamertag ZeRo, is widely considered to be the best Smash 4 player in the world. This has been proven through his consistently excellent tournament results. He has also shown great skill in other Smash games, prior to Smash 4 he consistently placed high in tournaments for Melee, Brawl, and Project M. This has also led to him being considered among some of the greatest Smash players of all time, such as Jason “Mew2King” Zimmerman, Justin “Wizzrobe” Hallet, Eric “ESAM” Lew, and Larry “Lurr” Holland. To date, he has earned approximately $180,871.29 from competitive Smash, with $170,758.77 from Smash 4 alone.</p>
            <p>ZeRo had a rough childhood, as his parents divorced while he was very young, and his mother could not find a stable income to provide for him. He lived in poverty for much of his early childhood, and on top of this he was bullied at school. He said himself that he was “the fat kid nobody cared about, and I was quiet because people always told me to shut up”. This eventually led to him dropping out of school. His mother soon after bought a GameCube and ZeRo got a hold of a copy of Super Smash Brothers Melee, where he found solace. He spent hours working at the game and figuring out how it worked for fun. Soon, he learned of Melee being played competitively in his area and decided to test his skill.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6"><p>He attended his first Melee tournament in 2006, but did not compete. He turned around and left because he was too nervous. But, he soon overcame this fear and grew to love the thrill of the bracket. He started going to more tournaments, and when he was not competing, he was working with his mother so he could afford to keep competing. Soon, he began dominating his local scene, in both Melee, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl once it was released. He then discovered that people in the United States were making a living through competitive gaming, and this drove him even further.</p>
            <p>His first recorded tournament win was in 2011, first place in Chile’s Second National Brawl Tournament. His prevalent strength on home soil caused him to decide it was time to move on to bigger ventures. ZeRo’s first international event was Apex 2012, where he placed 17th in singles and 9th in doubles. However, these placings do not pay bills. ZeRo returned to Chile, set on the monumental goal of making the game his living.</p>
            <p>In 2013, ZeRo asked his mother to let him live in the United States for a year to try and do just that, with the proposition that after a year if he had no results he would return and find a real job. His mother agreed and he moved to Philadelphia, where he slowly turned the game into his career. He practiced Brawl, and used his tournament winnings to pay his friend’s family’s rent. Everything else he earned was returned to Smash to better his performance and tournament attendance, spending hours on buses traveling across the country and studying the game and top players.</p>

        <div class="row">    
            <div class="col-12 col-sm-6"><p>While he was effectively making a living out of Brawl, he did not establish himself as a dominant force in Smash until the fourth installment in the series was released. Nintendo held an invitational tournament prior to the game’s release with some of the biggest names in Smash in attendance. ZeRo took the tournament, albeit it had a non-standard ruleset. After his victory, he placed 3rd at a tournament with standard rules. Then, he began his unmatched 53 tournament win streak, during which he was signed by Team SoloMid, an eSports team. He was not just winning, he was destroying everybody else by a large margin.</p>
            <p>After his streak was broken, he continued to dominate and show why he was undefeated for so long. Unfortunately, he was soon struck with an injury in his hand that prevented him playing for months. Being out of practice allowed his competition to catch up while he could not play. He then had a low point in his career with inconsistent placings outside of spots he used to own with ease. ZeRo eventually bounced back, and regained his seat on the throne. At the end of 2017, he announced his retirement from the game, and was announced to be #1 in the world for the fourth season in a row on the widely accepted player scale, PGR, for Smash 4.</p>
            <p> “I wanted to beat everybody. I wanted to beat every single character, every single player. I wanted to beat the best players from everywhere. I just wanted to build something that I felt was unshakeable, that I felt I would be so satisfied with that I could just turn the page on it and look back on it and say I did all the work for that.” – Gonzalo “ZeRo” Barrios</p>

          <p>To the left, you can see ZeRo's Panda Global Ranking placements, or PGR placements for short. He has consistently been number one every season since the system was implemented. Panda Global is another team that sponsors high level eSports competitors, and this is their ranking system, hence the name. For the first one, or PGR v1, they ranked players based on tournament placings and set counts, with a heavy ephasis on a few major events. In PGR v2, the stats team behind the rankings started placing tournaments in to seperate groups or "tiers" based on ranked entrants and entrants in general in attendance. PGR v3 introduced the Tournament Tier System (TTS) which factored in entrants, PGR v2 attendees, top 20 PGR v2 attendees, and the prize pool to more accurately rank tournaments. PGR v4 featured the return of the TTS system but with minor changes. Rather than combining points based on a tournaments entrants / prize pool, it is determined by either a combination of total entrants and prize pool, or the attendance of PGR players. Whatever way, ZeRo has proven triumphant every time.</p>
